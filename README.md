# Ready For New Challenges!

With over a decade of experience in software development, I have successfully worked on diverse solutions, including web and desktop applications, RESTful APIs, and microservices. My technical expertise spans a range of technologies, such as .NET, C#, SQL Server, Node.js, and JavaScript, enabling me to design and implement scalable, efficient systems.

I am a lifelong learner, passionate about emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, Deno, and Fresh. I also enjoy exploring areas like video editing and am currently learning about Shopify and e-commerce.

If you would like to learn more or have any questions, please feel free to contact me. I am always willing to connect and share ideas!

<i>This joke plays on the idea that the node_modules folder is ridiculously large and heavy, even more so than the densest objects in the universe, such as black holes.
